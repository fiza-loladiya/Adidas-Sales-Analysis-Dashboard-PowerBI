# 👟 Adidas Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is a **Power BI Sales & Profitability Dashboard** built using an **Adidas sales dataset (Kaggle)**.  
The goal was to turn raw transactional data into **decision-ready insights** around **sales trends, operating profit, operating margin %, units sold, pricing**, and performance across **regions, states, products, retailers, and sales methods**.

## 📌 Project Overview

A big sales number looks impressive—but the real question is: **where is profit actually coming from?**

This dashboard helps answer:
- Which **regions/states** drive the most sales and operating profit?
- Which **products** and **retailers** contribute the most?
- How do **sales methods** (In-store, Outlet, Online) impact performance?
- What does **seasonality** look like by month and year?
- How healthy is the business in terms of **margin %** and **average price per unit**? 


## 🎯 Problem Statement
The analysis was designed to evaluate Adidas performance using these KPI goals:
- **Total Sales Analysis** (overall sales performance over time)
- **Profitability Analysis** (operating profit across dimensions)
- **Sales Volume Analysis** (total units sold to understand demand)
- **Pricing Strategy** (average price per unit)
- **Margin Analysis** (operating margin % / average margin) 


## 📊 Key KPIs (Dashboard Summary)
- **Overall Sales:** **$899.9M**
- **Total Operating Profit:** **$332.1M**
- **Total Units Sold:** **2M**
- **Operating Margin %:** **36.91%**
- **Avg Price per Unit:** **$45.22**
- **Retailers Count:** **6** 


## 🧩 Dashboard Highlights (What’s Inside)

### 1) Sales Trend (Year & Month)
- A time-series chart to identify seasonality and peak periods.
- The report highlights peak months like **July** and **August** in the overall analysis narrative. 

### 2) Regional Performance (Sales + Profit + Margin)
- **Total Sales by Region** donut chart
- **Operating Profit by Region** bar chart
- **Operating Margin % by Region** comparison  
Example: West leads total sales contribution (~30%). 
### 3) State-wise Sales Distribution
- Filled map / state contribution view to identify high-performing states (e.g., New York, California, Florida, Texas appear as top contributors). 

### 4) Product Performance
- Product-level sales and demand using bar charts.
- Units sold by product helps spot demand leaders. 

### 5) Retailer Performance
- Total sales by retailer (West Gear, Foot Locker, etc.) to understand distribution strength. 

### 6) Sales Method Mix
- Sales split across **In-store, Outlet, Online** with contribution percentages.
